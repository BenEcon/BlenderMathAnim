Once you cloned the repository, you need to install the bpy library.<br>
This is what worked for me:<br>
Linux<br>
<br>
activate your virtual environment (you should most conveniently use the python distributed with your blender installation)<br>
source venv/bin/activate.fish  (sorry, I use fish terminals)<br>
<br>
Then you can just run<br>
pip install bpy<br>
pip install mathutils<br>
<br>
and the current bpy-wheelis downloaded and bpy and mathutils are installed<br>
