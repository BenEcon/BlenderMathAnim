Once you cloned the repository, you need to install the bpy library.
This is what worked for me:
Linux

activate your virtual environment (you should most conveniently use the python distributed with your blender installation)
source venv/bin/activate.fish  (sorry, I use fish terminals)

Then you can just run
pip install bpy
pip install mathutils

and the current bpy-wheelis downloaded and bpy and mathutils are installed
